        This function isn't especially elegant, but it's functional.

        VisionEgg's keyboard libraries records a keypress and timestamp every
        time something is down.  So if a key is held down for 100 ms, there will
        be an entry in the keylist for every sample during that 100ms.  This is
        a bit much; I'd rather just save onsets and offsets for every key.  This
        function evaluates that.
