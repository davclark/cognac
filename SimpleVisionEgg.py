        DEPRECATED!

        Use this function to get responses from the keyboard controller in real
        time.

        Returns (None, None) if no new response is available.
        Maintains three instance variables - keys, presses and releases, which
        you can also access directly (but they won't be updated during loops
        where you don't call this function)

        This function makes a number of assumptions and is a little brittle
        right now.  By not hard-coding the min_interval and maybe using key
        presses and release events directly, we'd have a much better function.
        But I don't really care right now.
