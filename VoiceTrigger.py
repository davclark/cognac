''' 
Classes to register voice-trigger RTs and save wave-files of those resps.

To be sure that your stim timing goes smoothly, ALWAYS try to save your sound
file at a time when nothing else is happening by specifying its duration to not
overlap with other important events. Save sounds from your experiment script using
voice_controller.write_soundfiles(). See VT_test_exp.py for an example.

You sometimes see a few lines of the "[Errno Input overflowed] -9981" upon startup,
but it doesn't seem to affect anything. Fiddle with CHUNK_SIZE to change these --
the optimum value differs from computer to computer. More info in the
VoiceTriggerController docstring.

Make sure python doesn't quit before the final recording is finished!
That will prevent it from being saved.

Records a soundfile more often than for every trial, but includes a line in the
logfile that tells you the filename of the sound file for that trial. Sound files
are saved to the working directory, and are 2 sec long by default.

Records the sound file from the start of the noise, not the start of the trial.

class VoiceTriggerController(Flow.Controller):
    ''' VisionEgg.Controller class to check for voice-trigger events
    and post them to the pygame event queue.

    To use, add an instance of this controller to the visionegg presentation using:
    ...presentation.add_controller(None, None, voice_controller_instance)

    Includes a method for setting the trigger threshold (set_threshold_gui).

    This class reads the audio stream at a rate determined by the sampling
    rate and the chunk size. Each call to stream.read will take this much time:
        (1/RATE) * CHUNK_SIZE  [in seconds per sample]
    If RATE = 44100 and CHUNK_SIZE = 256, you can sample at about 172 Hz.
    If RATE = 44100 and CHUNK_SIZE = 512, you sample at about half that: 86 Hz.

    Increasing the chunk size causes the program to wait for that to return,
    which increases the average frame rate drastically. Keep this small! 
    It's important to check that
    the parameters you're using don't cause the Inter-Frame Interval (IFI)
    to increase over your screen refresh time (usually 16.7 ms). Check this with
    the report that VisionEgg gives when it quits (the histogram at terminal)
    and the VisionEgg.log file. 

    Sound files must be saved using voice_controller_instance.write_soundfiles()
    called from your experiment script! Do this at a time when saving files won't
    interfere with the timing of the stims/responses.
